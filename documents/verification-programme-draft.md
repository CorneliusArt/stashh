## Process

When a creator believes that they have met one of the Preconditions for verification they request verification via a form. Verification will not be automatic, and there is no requirement for any creator to go through verification.

### Email & Doxxing

Stashh will send an email to the creators email address explaining that the account has requested verification, and asking them to confirm ownership, and for their full legal name, country of residence, and date of birth.

This information will be stored securely. It will not be disclosed publicly.

### Social Media

Depending on the platform the creator will either need to…

Post a specific message publicly mentioning the Stashh account and a link to their collection

Respond to a direct message sent from the Stashh account asking them to verify their ownership

### Private Media

This will be reviewed by the Stashh team, and a number of tools will be used to detect copyrighted material.

Any private metadata provided to Stashh will be securely destroyed after verification has been completed successfully.

### Websites

Websites can be verified in 3 ways…

1. By adding a TXT record containing the address of the collection to the domains DNS
2. By creating a page on the site that contains a verification message
3. By responding to a message from the Stashh team sent to a Contact address listed on the site, or via a contact form.
